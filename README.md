## An alternative visual way to represent a realtime clock - Spiral Clock
this is regular text
When choosing to do this experiment I was inspired by a whirlpool and how things get sucked in towards the centre. To replicate this movement I tried a number of methods, including incremental rotations of stationary lines, using sin and cos to get positions and other unsuccessful methods. During the development of the final clock I started from scratch rather then using my prototypes of the clock, I did this because the method used to create the spiral look required a different technical implimentation that wouldn't be easily addapted from previous versions. I finally settled on usings Sin and Cos to get coordinates for a individual point on the clock, then drawing a line between each one and rotating the entire spiral for other the other hands. The dots indicating time use easing to move from one coordinate to another by having the time act as the value of the array of coordinates. Hours had to be multiplied by 2.5 to match the other hands progress along the spiral.
