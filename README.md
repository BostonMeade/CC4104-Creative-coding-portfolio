## An alternative visual way to represent a realtime clock - Spiral Clock
this is regular text
When choosing to do this experiment I was inspired by a whirlpool and how things get sucked in towards the centre. To replicate this movement I tried a number of methods, including incremental rotations of stationary lines, using sin and cos to get positions and other unsuccessful methods. During the development of the final clock I started from scratch rather then using my prototypes of the clock, I did this because the method used to create the spiral look required a different technical implimentation that wouldn't be easily addapted from previous versions. I finally settled on usings Sin and Cos to get coordinates for a individual point on the clock, then drawing a line between each one and rotating the entire spiral for other the other hands. The dots indicating time use easing to move from one coordinate to another by having the time act as the value of the array of coordinates. Hours had to be multiplied by 2.5 to match the other hands progress along the spiral.

One of the main features I wanted to include that guided my actions was wanting to include easing into the clock hands, this was why I went with creating coordinates over just rotating a line and moving origin points. I wanted to have the clock slowly spin to mimic my idea of a whirlpool, for the reason I have a universal rotation applied to the begining of the draw function using framecount to ensure a consisted rotation.
When creating the visuals of the clock I decided to go simple with just having the lines change colour as they got closer to the centre. My main issue with the current clock is the lack of way to accuratly read the clock at the centre points and fact the the hours hand travels much further for each hour, but the clock is meant to be a alternative way of repesenting a real time clock and I believe that I have achieved this.

## A city or landscape generator, with at least 3 distinct types of building or land - City Generator
I originally chose to create a city generator to mess around with the noise function introduced in class, I began by having a 2 dimensional sketch that had rectangles that would change colour based on 2 noise values. After learning how to create 3d sketches I took this idea and developed it into a city generator. I decided that I would have a spinning 3-dimensional city that would use noise to determine the height of buildings, ontop of having multiple building types that could appear. 
When I first started coding the 3D version I began by having lots of rectangles appear in a grid, then having those squares change colour based on the noise. Then I implimented camera controls and spinning, on top of the height differences. This version of the project had to be altered a decent amount due to me creating it in the incorrect axis, making the camera controls confusing to use. Altering the project to work on the correct axis didn't take long.

Within the programs setup function, it will obtain the positions of the grid of buildings and will create a new Building object using 5 parameters, the X and Z axis's, the i and j values used to determine noise and a style which will determine the buildings type. Every function within the building class is a different show function for each building type. The first type is just a box with the given height. The second type is similar but includes an additional smaller box on top of the original box, giving a different visual shape to the building. The third type of building is just having the height multipled by 2 to create skyscraper-like buildings. The final type creates a park with a tree that has its overall size determined by the height.

## one key game (two players) with a clear win state - Tron Game
(When speaking to Dave about the amount of keys I got told that we were allowed to use 2 keys per player)
I chose to create a 2 player game because I want to create games, however I had trouble thinking of an intresting 2 player game that I could create when given only a single key. After finding out that we could use 2 keys I elected to recreate one of my favourite games, tron. The basic idea is 2 players with trails behind them that cannot be passed through.

When making this I decided to adapt one of my character movers from a Snake project that I had worked on independently. However I did have to adapt it to include a additional check to make sure that only the correct player would move if a key were pressed as KeyIsDown would apply an additional time if an another key is pressed while it is down, potentialy resulting in a unintended turn. This was solved by including an additional functtion that checked the last key that was pressed. Below is the code included to make it work.

I wanted to make it so that you wouldn't need to reload the page each time you wanted to replay the game so I included a way to get rid of the existing player and trail objects and then remaking the player objects, allowing a replay button to be used. 
There is a big issue with the framerate dropping the longer the game goes on, this is due to the way the collision with the trails is handled. Each trail is doing a check each frame where they see if they are colliding with a player and then they make said player's alive variable equal false. At higher trail counts this function is running upwards of 50 times a frame, causing the frame drops.
